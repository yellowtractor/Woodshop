title: How it works
---
##1. Visit
We are a small company, not motivated by volume sales.
Once you have contacted us with a brief description of what you would like, a short visit is arranged to measure for a quote.

##2. Draw
Scaled drawings are created for every quote, for which we request a small refundable *drawing fee* (we usually charge around: Â£75).

##3. Price
We are not sales people and there is no hard selling.  
Your quote and scale drawing will simply be emailed to you, with the choice to complete the order left up to you.

##4. Survey
With orders for fully fitted alcove furniture, if you choose to proceed, a full survey is then completed.
Full surveys take 30 minutes.  At which, a 30% deposit is requested - minus the quote *drawing fee*, and an estimated delivery or fitting date will be provided.
