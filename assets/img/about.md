title: About the Designer
---

**Gary Thomson** grew up among the silver, granite architecture of [Aberdeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen), and takes much of the inspiration for his fine work in wood, from many of the world renowned buildings that flank its main streets.
  
Cast a gaze upward across Union Street, and visitors can catch a glimpse of some of his most popular designs, mirrored in many a hidden: *fluted column*, *corbel* or *cornice pediment*, that pepper the city’s monuments and public entrances.

As the designer’s primary sources of inspiration come from places of interest around his city and its wider natural environment, his bespoke creations always look fresh and unique; designed to enhance your work or living space - in a way that will never look outdated.

His passion for his work can be seen - in the results, and one burning ambition - as he always says - is to exceed the expectations of his clients.
